# CS4423-Farmers VS Zombies
In "Farmers vs. Zombies," players defend their farm from hordes of invading zombies using a variety of resourceful farmers. The objective remains the same as in the original game, "Plants vs. Zombies": to strategically position different types of farmers equipped with unique abilities and tools to prevent waves of zombies from reaching and overrunning the farm. 

Each farmer has distinct skills, such as pea-shooting farmers, sunflower farmers that produce sunlight for resource generation, wall-nut farmers that act as defensive barriers, Frost farmers for Slowing down zombies and many more. As the game progresses, players unlock and upgrade new types of farmers, enhancing their defensive capabilities against increasingly challenging zombie assaults.

The game's mechanics involve planting, harvesting, and strategically positioning farmers across the farm grid to fend off zombies advancing in different lanes. Players must manage resources efficiently, plan their defenses, and adapt their strategies to counter diverse zombie threats, including stronger and more resilient zombie types as they progress through levels. 

Ultimately, the goal in "Farmers vs. Zombies" remains to protect the farmstead from being overrun by the relentless zombie horde using a clever assortment of resourceful farmers.
